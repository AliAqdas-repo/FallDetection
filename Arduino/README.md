# Fall Detection on Arduino
The files in this directory are an implementation of Fall Detection on **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense**. We have used Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers to implement our deep learning model in Arduino which is powered by an nRF52840 microcontroller.

# Results
Upon providing a simulated fall, our algorithm works by generating different colours on LED. When falls are detected we **Red** output whereas for Activities of Daily Life (ADLs) we get **Blue** output.
